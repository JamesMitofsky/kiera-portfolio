    Welcome to my page! I’m a Canadian artist living in the English Channel on
    the Isle of Jersey. If you’re looking for an extroverted cartoonist,
    illustrator, and animator to crack some jokes and make some art, you’ve come
    to the right place.

    I’m an honours graduate of Arts University Bournemouth with a degree in
    Animation Production. I have been working professionally as an artist since
    2018, as both a freelance artist and an in-house cartoonist for Jersey’s
    Kartoon Faktory. My work has been exhibited in the Jersey Museum, the CCA
    Gallery of St Helier, as well as having been published in several children’s
    books. I have worked as a character designer, storyboard artist, animator,
    visual development artist, cartoonist, illustrator, director, and writer
    throughout my freelance and university work.

    I have a taste for working traditionally, however I am more than proficient
    in industry standard software, including but not limited to: Photoshop,
    After Effects, Premier Pro, ToonBoom Harmony, and Procreate. I'm an
    enthusiastic worker and team player, and I’m always keen to learn new things
    and take on any challenges that come with the job. I love creating art and
    any new way to do that is welcome knowledge to me.
